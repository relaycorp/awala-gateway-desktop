# Awala Gateway for Windows and Linux

macOS is not currently supported, although it _might_ work with some minimal changes.

## Development

### System dependencies

You only need Node.js 12+ installed.

### Setup

```shell
npm install
npm run bootstrap
```

### Code structure

This is a monorepo and all components can be found under [`packages`](./packages).
